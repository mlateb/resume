Please feel free to use this simple publishing tool for your own documents. Simply edit resume.md
to your liking, and run the `publish` script to generate html, doc, odt and pdf versions. You'll 
need to adapt the `publish` script if you want to use it on files that are named something other 
than "resume".

To see the generated html version live go to http://jacksenechal.com/resume/.

Requirements

- pandoc
